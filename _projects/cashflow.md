Cashflow is a simple cashflow management tool designed for personal finances (although it could theoretically be used by coompanies to measure their profitability). 

It provides a simple interface to manage incomes & expenses, and gives useful metrics and visualizations such as capital growth, cash balance & more.

One key characteristics that Cashflow has compared to other cashflow managers is that it enables the user to input some uncertainty in the cashflows. The metrics and visualizations come with tolerance intervals and iso-probability bands to assist decision-making.
