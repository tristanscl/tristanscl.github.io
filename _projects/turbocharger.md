This project is a design case study completed as a team during the 2nd year at Arts et Métiers. The goal of it is to apply turbomachine design principles to solve a real-world engineering challenge which is the one of air supply for fuel cells on hydrogen cars. It goes through every stages of the development of a new product, from architecture design to trials of a prototype. 

Tools used during that project were: 
* Python (sizing, data analysis...)
* CAD: Autodesk Fusion 360 & CATIA V5 (GSD & part design)
* CFD: Star-CCM+
* FDM additive manufacturing

We won't go into further details in that page, we feature the report & final presentation for that (in French):
