Hi, my name is Tristan Scuiller. I am an aerospace engineering graduate student at the Georgia Institute of Technology. Before that, I was in France where I completed my diplôme d'ingénieur at Ecole Nationale Supérieure d'Arts et Métiers, after two years of prépa at Stanislas, Paris. I also have a BS in Physics from Université Paris-Saclay I obtained alongside my main curriculum.

This website is both my personal portfolio and my blog. I featured all the most relevant projects I did, and I post about topics in STEM that interest me.

For any special request, please email me at [tristanscuillereng@gmail.com](mailto:tristanscuillereng@gmail.com)
